## Dead simple components with a dead simple API.

Love to build cool stuff with styled-components? But hate the amount of work it takes to just get some basic styling in place?

already-styled is here to help. A set of components created with styled-components to get you up and running fast! Need other styles? Just extend the the components in this library with `styled(component)` from the styled-component library.
